# [19] Paradox

Almost all companies require inventory management to function effectively and efficiently. Inventory management is the process of overseeing the flow of units into and out of existing stock.

Before digital integration into business processes, inventory management tools were paper based, which was problematic as it took too much time and sometimes even required dedicated employees from the organization to perform inventory management tasks. Human fault rate was high and there was no way of tracing inventory losses due to human error.

A software based solution can bring efficiency to inventory management, and perform inventory management tasks accurately and effortlessly.
